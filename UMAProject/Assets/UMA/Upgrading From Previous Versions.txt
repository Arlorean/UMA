Upgrading from previous versions

You should remove the previous UMA folder before importing! If this is not possible, at the very least, remove the CORE and EXAMPLES folders.

To use this version of UMA, you must have the Addressables package 1.5.0 or later installed from the package manager.

Old asset bundles will NOT work in this version. You must switch to the Addressable Bundles.

To upgrade a project:

1. Install Addressables 1.5.0 or greater
2. Import the new UMA 2.10 
3. In your scene, delete the UMA_DCS prefab.
4. Add the UMA_GLIB prefab from the "UMA/Getting Started" folder
5. On the UMA Generator, make sure "Enable Cache Cleanup" is OFF.
6. Open the Addressable groups window and dock it. (Windows/AssetManagement/Addressables/Groups)
7. Edit the default settings in the default group as needed. These settings will be used for the generated groups.

. Open the new "Global Library (Experimental)" window. This is the new global library.
. Select the "(Re)Generate Groups" option from the Addressables menu in the Global Library.
